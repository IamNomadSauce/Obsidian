- ### Artesenal Yeast
	- #### Ingredients
		- - 3 cups (450g) flour , bread or plain/all purpose (Note 1)
		- ▢2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast (Note 2 for normal / active dry yeast)
		- ▢2 tsp cooking / kosher salt , NOT table salt (Note 3)
		- ▢1 1/2 cups (375 ml) very warm tap water , NOT boiling or super hot (ie up to 55°C/130°F) (Note 4)
	- #### Dough shaping
		- ▢1 1/2 tbsp flour , for dusting
	- ### Instructions
		- **Mix Dough:** Mix flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable, but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency (see video at 17 sec, Note 5).
		- **Rise:** Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 – 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer (Note 6).
		- _**Optional – refrigerate for flavour development (Note 9):**_ _At this stage, you can either bake immediately (move onto Step 5) or refrigerate for up to 3 days._
		- _**Take chill out of refrigerated dough**_ _– if you refrigerated dough per above, leave the bowl on the counter for 45 – 60 minutes while the oven is preheating. Cold dough does not rise as well._
    
		- **Preheat oven** (Note 7) – Put dutch oven in oven with lid on (26cm/10" or larger). Preheat to 230°C/450°F (220° fan) 30 minutes prior to baking. (Note 8 for no dutch oven)
		    
		- **Shape dough:** Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour.
		    
		- Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move.
		    
		- **Transfer to paper:** Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. _Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!_
		    
		- **Dough in pot:** Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot, place lid on.
		    
		- **Bake** 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy.
		    
		- **Cool** on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.
