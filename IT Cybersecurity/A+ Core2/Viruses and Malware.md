## Policy Considerations:
- Scan email attachments
- Scan external storage devices
- Require anti-virus software
- Restrict the use of personal devices
- Restrict the access of unnecessary software

## Procedures for Malware removal
1. Identify and research Malware symptoms
	- Error Messages
	- Performance issues
2. Quarantine the infected systems
	1. Remove system from the network (Both LAN and WAN)
	2. Remove, disinfect, quarantine the infected files
3. Disable System Restore in Windows
	- Malware may infect prior restore points
	- Disabling system restore will delete previous restore points.
4. Remediate the infected systems
	- Check running processes
		- Task Manager
		- Process Explorer
		- Tasklist
	-  Update software and engine (if possible)
	-  Boot into Safe Mode
	-  Boot into a pre-installation environment like Windows PE
	-  Testing:
		1. Restart PC
		2. Check status of Malware
			1. Did it return?
5. Schedule scans and run updates
	 - Real-time Scanning
	 - Scheduled scanning
	 - Update Types:
		 - Definition Files
		 - Engine
	- Scan storage media
	- Scan email attachments
6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point (in Windows)
	- Turn on System Protection in the *System Settings*
	- Re-enable system restore and create a fresh restore point
7. Educate the end user
	- Create a culture of security and training
	- Coaching initiatives
	- Posters, signs, banners
	- Login messages
	- Message boards
	- Avoid opening certain file types:
		- .exe
		- .pif
		- .vbs
		- .bat
	- Do not download from unknown sources
	- Do not disable security controls / anti-virus
