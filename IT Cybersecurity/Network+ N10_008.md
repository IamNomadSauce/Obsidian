- #### Business Continuity
	- #### Cold Site
		- a location that consists of a building, facilities, desks, toilets, parking—everything that a business needs…except computers. A cold site generally takes more than a few days to bring online.
	- #### Warm Site
		- starts with the same components as a cold site, but adds computers loaded with software and functioning servers—a complete hardware infrastructure. A warm site lacks current data and may not have functioning Internet/network links. Bringing this site up to speed may start with activating your network links, and it most certainly requires loading data from recent backups. A warm site should only take a day or two to bring online.
	- #### Hot Site
		- has everything a warm site does, but also includes very recent backups. It might need just a little data restored from a backup to be current, but in many cases a hot site is a complete duplicate of the primary site. A proper hot site should only take a few hours to bring online.
- Being the First Responder:
	- Secure the Area
	- Document the scene
	- Collect evidence
